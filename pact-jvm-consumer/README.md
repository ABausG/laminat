Pact consumer
=============

Pact Consumer is used by projects that are consumers of an API.

Most projects will want to use pact-consumer via one of the test framework specific projects.

If your favourite framework is not implemented, this module should give you all the hooks you need.

Please let us know if you build one and we'll link to you from the main page.
