pact-jvm-provider-gradle
========================

Gradle plugin for verifying pacts against a provider.

The Gradle plugin creates a task `pactVerify` to your build which will verify all configured pacts against your provider.

## To Use It

1. Add the pact-jvm-provider-gradle jar file to your build script class path:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'au.com.dius:pact-jvm-provider-gradle_2.10:2.0.1'
    }
}
```

2. Apply the pact plugin

```groovy
apply plugin: 'pact'
```

3. Define the pacts between your consumers and providers

```groovy

pact {

    serviceProviders {

        // You can define as many as you need, but each must have a unique name
        provider1 {
            // All the provider properties are optional, and have sensible defaults (shown below)
            protocol = 'http'
            host = 'localhost'
            port = 8080
            path = '/'

            // Again, you can define as many consumers for each provider as you need, but each must have a unique name
            hasPactWith('consumer1') {

                // currenty supports a file path, but soon will support any URL
                pactFile = file('path/to/provider1-consumer1-pact.json')

            }

        }

    }

}
```

4. Execute `gradle pactVerify`
