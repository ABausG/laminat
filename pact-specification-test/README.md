Pact Specification
==================

The [Pact Specification](https://github.com/bethesque/pact_specification) is a robust set of tests on the pact matching
code aimed at ensuring pact library implementations across different languages have the same matching behaviour.

Without adhering to these specifications there would be room for subtle issues to arise between consumers and providers
using different libraries.

We are currently aiming for 1.0.0 of the specification, however it is still in development.
